        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For this fish recipe, your best bet is to use a flaky white fish, such as tilapia, halibut, cod, bass, grouper, haddock, catfish or snapper. White fish doesnâ€™t mean that the fish is white in color; rather, it is a mild-flavored fish that cooks quickly and seasons very well. Learn more about the different types of fish.</p>
